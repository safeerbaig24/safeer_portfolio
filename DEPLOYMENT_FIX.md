# Fix for Blank Page Issue

## What Was Fixed:
- Changed `homepage` in `package.json` from full URL to relative path: `/safeer_portfolio`
- This ensures all assets (CSS, JS, images) load correctly on GitHub Pages

## Steps to Fix the Deployment:

1. **Clean any previous builds**:
```bash
rm -rf build
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
```

2. **Rebuild the project**:
```bash
npm run build
```

3. **Verify the build was successful** - Check that the `build` folder was created and contains:
   - `index.html`
   - `static/` folder with CSS and JS files

4. **Redeploy to GitHub Pages**:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

5. **Wait a few minutes** and then refresh:
   - https://safeerbaig24.github.io/safeer_portfolio/

## If Still Blank:

1. **Check browser console** (F12 â†’ Console tab) for any errors
2. **Verify GitHub Pages is enabled**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/safeerbaig24/safeer_portfolio/settings/pages
   - Make sure "Source" is set to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch should be `gh-pages`
   - Folder should be `/ (root)`

3. **Clear browser cache** or try incognito mode

4. **Check the gh-pages branch**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/safeerbaig24/safeer_portfolio/tree/gh-pages
   - Verify `index.html` and `static/` folder exist

## Alternative: If Path Format Doesn't Work

If the relative path doesn't work, try changing back to full URL in `package.json`:
```json
"homepage": "https://safeerbaig24.github.io/safeer_portfolio"
```

But the relative path `/safeer_portfolio` is usually more reliable.
